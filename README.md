# Book Search Engine

## Description

I took a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. 

I completed the following:

1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
2. Modified the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
3. Created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
4. Deployed the application to Heroku.

## Deployed Application

[https://shrouded-basin-50525.herokuapp.com/](https://shrouded-basin-50525.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

This application allows users to search books. Users are able to create an account by providing username, email and password.
Once logged in, users are able to save their favorite books. Users can navigate to 'See Your Books' where all the saved books are displayed and the are also able to remove a book from thir saved books. Saved books are stored in their account, so next time they login, the books are still avaiable in their account to be viewed.
